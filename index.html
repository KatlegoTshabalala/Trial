        Youth Day is an annual state holiday in South Africa that was implemented to commemorate the historical value of the June 16th Soweto revolt. <br> 
        The day reminds South Africa of the bravery of those students in 1976, and the great importance of having a country that supports its youth. <br> <br>
        On this day, thousands of black students protested against the government's decision to enforce the use of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in schools. This policy was seen as a symbol of the broader apartheid system's oppression. <br>
                <br>
        In honor of this historic event, South Africa celebrates Youth Day every year on June 16th, recognizing the role played by young people in the fight for freedom and equality

    <p style = "color:#000000 ; font-size:20pt; font-family: Arial MS"> The oppressive system of Apartheid, a dark chapter in South African history, was the outcome of a sophisticated web of legislation meant to institutionalise racial inequality. This legal structure, which enabled white supremacy over other racial groups, was established via a series of acts and legislatiion. While the majority of these disctiminatory measures were put in place following the National Party's electoral victory in 1948, it had its antecedents in earlier British and Afrikaner governments. Apartheid is distinguished from other kinds of segregation across the world by the thorough and methodical manner in which it was codified in legislation.

    <center> <p style = "color:#000000 ; font-size:25pt; font-family: Arial MS"> The segregation policies established during Apartheid were ones so extreme that they extended to more than housing, transportation, and land access. The introduction of Afrikaans and English as the primary mediums of instruction for all schools is considered to be the immediate cause of the Soweto Uprising, resulting in the deaths of 176 but as many as 700 young pupils. </center>

    As the protest turned violent, the deaths occured included the tragic death of Hector Pieterson, a young boy. The Soweto Uprising marked a significant turning point in the struggle against apartheid, galvanizing youth and sparking a series of protests and resistance movements across South Africa.
